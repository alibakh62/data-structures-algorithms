# Welcome
At its core, this program is about how to write code to  **solve problems**  and to do so  **efficiently**.

You're probably well aware that computers can be used to solve all sorts of problems—from calculating the fastest route on a map, to sequencing the human genome. But there is almost always more than one way to solve a problem, and some ways can be dramatically more efficient than others. Two approaches may solve the same problem, but one may take milliseconds, while the other takes hours.

How do you look at a problem and identify different ways that you could solve it? And how do you know which approaches are more or less efficient? Will your solution run quickly or slowly? Will it take up a lot of space in the computer's memory, or only a little? Being able to answer these kinds of questions will make you a more effective developer—and also help you perform much better during technical interviews.

The key to mastering these skills is practice. Simply hearing about algorithms and data structures will not make you proficient at analyzing or implementing them in a real-world situation. For that reason, our goal in this program is not only to explain key concepts, but also to give you lots of chances to practice the key skills through hands-on exercises.

# How to solve problems?
Solving problems is one of the most important skills you can learn. Here, we're going to look at how to approach complicated programming problems. We're going to look at a specific problem and talk about how we would go about solving that. Our goal by looking at a particular problem is not just to solve that particular problem but to draw some general lessons about how we can get better as problem solvers.

## Example Problem:
The problem statement is as follows:

"_Given your birthday and the current date, calculate your age in days. Compensate for leap days. Assume that the birthday and current date are correct dates (and no time travel). Simply put, if you were born 1 Jan 2012 and today's date is 2 Jan 2012, you're one day old._"
